    <h2>Welcome to the Bible Book Club!</h2>
    <.>
        We are a group of people who are passionate about studying Christian history and Christianity’s impact on the
        world. This season, we will be reading history books about the early church, written by renowned scholar and
        historian <a
            href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/podcasts/where-ya-from-podcast/doing-theology-in-context-with-dr-justo-gonzlez.html">Justo
            Gonzalez</a>.</p>
        <p>We kick off our reading of <b>“The Bible in the Early Church”</b> by Justo Gonzalez on August 27, 2023.
            After 6 weeks of personal reading, we will meet on Zoom to discuss the book. The exact day and time will be
            determined via a vote from the book club participants.</p>
        <p>I encourage you to post your book reflections on Facebook, Twitter, or Instagram using the hashtag
            <b>#BibleBookClub</b>. This is a
            great
            way to connect with other people share your thoughts and insights on with other book club members.
